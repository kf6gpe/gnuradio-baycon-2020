# The Automated Packet Reporting System...
*  Was developed by Bob Bruniga, WB4APR beginning in 1984
*  Is a packet format for the exchange telemetry, messages, and position over amateur radio
*  Uses primarily AFSK ("packet radio") on 2m (144.390 MHz in the US)
*  Is widely used for tactical work in public service 

# What can you do?
*  Share position information with other stations
*  Obtain local weather conditions
*  Short text messaging between stations or to SMS or email
*  Satellite operations through the ISS or cubesats

#  Getting on the air
## What you need
*  Software for Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS or Android
*  A PC, tablet, or cell phone (portable is fun!)
*  A 2m radio
*  TNC or soft modem cable for your radio
*  (Optional) GPS receiver

# Terminology
*  _Callsign_ - Your callsign
*  _SSID_ - A unique integer from 1-15 to identify your station
*  _Icon_ - An icon identifying your station on the map
*  _Digipeater_ - A station that repeats (digipeats) packets
*  _IGate_ - A station configured to route packets to (and possibly from) the Internet

# Frequencies & APRSIS hostnames
*  144.390 MHz - National Simplex APRS Frequency
*  145.825 MHz - Satellite uplink / downlink
*  rotate.aprs2.net - Picks an appropriate APRSIS server
*  noam.aprs2.net - APRSIS server for North America
*  euro.aprs2.net - APRSIS server for Europe

# Software
*  APRSIS32 - Windows, very full featured
*  PinPoint APRS - Windows, good UI, best for monitoring 
*  YAAC - Java, all platforms, a bit fiddly 
*  APRSdroid - Android
*  PocketPacket - iOS & Mac OS
*  aprs.fi (iOS, not the web site)

# Older software
### You'll see these, don't bother trying with them!
*  UIView-32
*  MacAPRS & WinAPRS
*  javAPRS (for embedding in a Web browser)

# Radios
*  Kenwood TH-D7A, TH-D72A (GPS), TH-D74A (GPS, D-STAR, & Bluetooth)
*  Kenwood TH-D700, TH-D710
*  Yaesu VX-8DR, FT1DR, FT2DR, FT3DR
*  PicoAPRS mini-APRS Transceiver
*  MicroTrak tracker from Byonics
*  Any other 2m radio connected to a Mobilinkd Bluetooth TNC

# Connecting to the network
*  Bluetooth
*  USB (and USB-to-serial)
*  Sound modem
*  TCP/IP

# Bluetooth
*  Low-power, wireless protocol for audio and serial
*  Bluetooth Serial replaces RS-232 or USB serial
*  Works with some KISS TNCs (Mobilinkd, Kenwood TH-D74A/E)
*  Great choice for portable with Android smartphones
*  Can work with Windows, but expect weird problems.
*  On iOS, only the Mobilinkd v3 works, and only with the aprs.fi app

# USB
*  Serial connections for the new millennium
*  Some TNCs and radios have USB
*  Others will require a USB-RS232 adapter
*  Drivers for USB-RS232 can be fussy!
*  Works with Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Android (maybe)

# Sound modem
*  Uses the sound card in your computer or an external adapter like a TigerTronics SignaLink.
*  PC, Mac and Linux need software (Direwolf, AGWPE, others)
*  Can be tricky to set up (not all APRS apps work with all sound modem apps)

# Sound modems and cell phones
*  APRSdroid and PocketPacket include sound card modem software!
*  Just hold your phone next to your radio...
*  ...or make a cable and use VOX

# TCP/IP
*  Used as backhaul to APRSIS
*  Most APRS clients support this today
*  Generally does _not_ transmit your telemetry to the RF network.
*  A great choice for learning on your cell phone!

# Setting up
*  Call sign and SSID
*  Icon (funky codes abound!)
*  Digipeater path (stick with WIDE1-1)

# It sounds complicated...
## But it isn't.
Most apps have a setup wizard. Know your callsign, SSID, passcode, and TNC port before you begin.

# Setting up for APRSIS access
*  You need a callsign and a passcode to transmit on APRSIS.
*  The passcode is generated from your callsign. It's semi-secret.
*  You can get the passcode from any APRS software author, or some hams.

# Setting up internet gating
*  You'll need your callsign and passcode (you're accessing APRSIS after all!)
*  Most APRS applications support Internet Gating; check the settings.
*  Do _not_ blindly transmit the APRSIS feed to the RF network. You'll swamp the channel!

# Messaging
*  Address a message to a callsign and send it.
*  Messages are _short_ - 60 characters or so.
*  Messages are retried a handful of times with exponential backoff.

# Special message recipients
*  SMSGTE 8885551212 Here's a text message
*  EMAIL2 kf6gpe@arrl.net Hi via APRS & email!
*  WXBOT

# Call to action
* Install APRS on your cell phone!
* Reach out to me for a passcode.
